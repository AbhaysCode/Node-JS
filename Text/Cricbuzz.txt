The last time India opted to bowl after winning the toss in a Test match was against South Africa in Bengaluru in 2015," informs our statsman Roshan Gede. Virat Kohli talking in the Indian team huddle. Off they disperse to take their respective positions. The Australian openers are out in the middle as well. Shami has the new Dukes ball in his hand and he'll start from round the wicket. Three slips and a gully in place. And, we're set...
"Cool and cloudy. Forecast is excellent," says Nasser Hussain. Ross Taylor - WTC winner - brings the mace out to the middle. Now, it's time for the players and the match officials to stride out. A minute silence in remembrance of the victims of the Odisha train accident. India's Jana Gana Mana followed Australia's Advance Australia Fair. The pre-match ritual is completed and the fireworks go off.
Teams:
Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey(w), Pat Cummins(c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland
India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Srikar Bharat(w), Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj
Pat Cummins: We would have bowled as well, I don't think it makes too much of a difference. Hopefully day four and five, there's a bit of spin. You think it suits his (Boland) bowling, he's in the same spot all day long. This wicket has a bit of grass, he'll be a key weapon. We've been here for about 10 days. Pretty fresh, weather has been nice, we haven't missed a session, feeling good.
Rohit Sharma: We are going to bowl. Jjust the conditions and also the weather being overcast. I don't think the pitch will change too much. You have to play good cricket and come out on top. Four seamers and one spinner. The spinner is Jadeja. It's always tough (to leave Ashwin), he's been a match-winner for us over the course of so many years. But you got to do the things that's needed for the team and eventually we came up with that decision. He (Rahane) brings a lot of experience, he's played 80-odd Test matches and he's done well for the team. He's been out for a while but but I don't think the experience that he has can change all of that.
India have won the toss and have opted to field
Right, the captains are out in their blazers for the toss. Cummins spins the coin, HEADS is the call from Rohit and HEADS it is...
DYK! The Oval has hosted 104 Tests but this final will be the first one to be played in June.
Pitch Report | Kumar Sangakkara: "It's cold, there's a bit of wind and it's overcast. There'll be swing. There's a lovely green covering of grass, so there'll be seam as well. You'll have very good bounce here." Win toss and bowl?
Australia have already named their playing XI. India, meanwhile, have a couple of selection headaches. Their top-five is expected to be same as the previous WTC final. Srikar Bharat is likely to get the nod over Ishan Kishan. In the bowling department, what combination will India go with? 'Three pacers + two spinners' or 'four pacers + one spinner'? Well, here's an update from Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) who is at the ground - "R Ashwin spending his time talking tactics with Rahul Dravid while Shardul Thakur does some stretching on the side."
09:30 Local Time, 08:30 GMT, 14:00 IST: Three cricketing nerds - Cheteshwar Pujara, Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith - come into this encounter on the back of some County Championship runs under their belt and more importantly, they'd be well acclimatised to English conditions. The Indian players, barring Pujara, arrive after taking part in a two-month festival called the Indian Premier League. David Warner and Cameron Green were key players to their respective teams in the IPL while the remaining Aussies will be playing competitive cricket after a long break. Will there be any signs of rustiness? Or can these modern cricketers shrug it off easily?
India's route to the final: It started here in England where they took a 2-1 lead in September 2021 but the fifth Test was postponed to July 2022. In between, they beat the Kiwis (the World Test Champions) at home but squandered a 1-0 lead in South Africa after which Virat Kohli stepped down as captain. Rohit Sharma kickstarted his Test captaincy stint with a 2-0 win at home over Sri Lanka but was forced to miss the rescheduled Test in Birmingham where India got BazBalled. India needed a lot of wins. They managed to blank 2-0 win in Bangladesh before the high-octane Borderâ€“Gavaskar Trophy. India retained the BGT, won their fourth successive Test series versus Australia (two in India and two in Australia) to book their berth in the final.
Australia's route to the final: Under new captain Pat Cummins, Australia got off to an auspicious start by winning the home Ashes 4-0 and retaining the urn. Then they toured Pakistan for the first time in 24 years to win the three-match series 1-0. They couldn't replicate it in Sri Lanka as the hosts came back to level the series 1-1. Down Under, Aussies had an incredible summer smashing West Indies 2-0 before beating South Africa in a home Test series for the first time in 17 years. Their last assignment was the toughest. Playing against India in India, they were down 0-2, but the Australians outshone the hosts in Indore which was a rank-turner and thereby sealed their WTC final spot.
09:15 Local Time, 08:15 GMT, 13:45 IST: The wait is finally over! This is one of the fiercest rivalries in world cricket. Australia versus India and this time at a neutral venue in England. The Dukes ball will be used for this contest. There's plenty of experience in both the camps. While India look to end their 10-year drought of an ICC title, Australia will be eyeing to add the only missing silverware to their overflowing trophy cabinet. Hello everyone and a warm welcome to the second World Test Championship Final! This is a massive finale. In addition to the ICC Test Championship mace, the winner will also take home a huge prize of $1.6 million.
Preview by Bharat Sundaresan

In pro-wrestling parlance, it's what they call fantasy booking. When you bring together two wrestlers or a tag-team from two different eras or two different territories and 'book' an imaginary match/bout between them. Especially when it seemed improbable that it could ever become a reality.

Say, Stone Cold Steve Austin versus Bill Goldberg at their peak in the late 1990s or a Shawn Michaels versus Daniel Bryan in more recent times.

Surely, you've done the same with cricket too, but in a slightly different context. What would it be like if Dennis Lillee bowled to Sachin Tendulkar or if Pat Cummins bowled to Virat Kohli on an English pitch during an English summer. While Lillee v Tendulkar will remain a fantasy, we are amazingly just a day away from seeing Cummins bowl to Kohli on a very English pitch during a very English-looking summer in London.

The second World Test Championship Final is upon us as the two most consistent Test teams over the last two years clash for a trophy, which despite fighting for relevance and context, remains a world title that neither have won. India of course fell short two years ago against an inspired New Zealand outfit in Southampton while Australia didn't even make it that far. And the two finalists have had two very different journeys to get to this point. While India has largely been in a rebuilding stage under Rohit Sharma following the end of the Kohli captaincy era, Australia have built themselves up under Cummins after parting ways with Tim Paine. As it turns out, India have played quite a bit in England in this current cycle, having had their five-match Test series in 2021 spread over two years. Australia, meanwhile, have the luxury for once to be in England on an 'Ashes' tour for a whole two weeks without having to obsess solely on England.

You can talk about how neither the lead-up, mainly owing to the placement of the match itself, and the setting, might not yet have the big event vibe or feel like the ultimate Test, which is what it's been built up to be. But the fact that it's been played at The Oval in early June, which brings with it several unknowns does add a huge layer of intrigue to how the match itself will play out, even if you do leave what's at stake aside. And it's this mystery around not knowing what to expect that should make what transpires at The Oval over the next five or so days a fascinating watch. That in itself of course is the whole magic of fantasy booking, only that we get the rare treat of seeing one of those dream matches play out for real, that too in a big 'final'.

Considering Australia haven't beaten India in a Test series in nearly 9 years, this also presents them an opportunity to upstage their new-age arch rivals before they go head-to-head against their more traditional ones.

When: Australia v India, World Test Championship Final, June 7-12, 2023, 10.30 hrs Local Time, 19:30 hrs AEST, 15:00 hrs IST

Where: The Oval, England

What to expect: You could leave home in your shorts in the morning and regret it by the evening or have that thick cardigan on your way to the tube stop to start with and regret it by midday. That's what it's felt like being in London over the last few days. Or as the locals would say, it's felt like June in England. The rains have stayed away and that expects to remain the case for the next five days, which should ensure that we get result without having to utilise the reserve, sixth day. The pitch has looked consistently browner as we near the starting date of the Test, and the grass was shaved to 6mm with less than 15 hours to go for the game. There will be runs on offer and the early County games have seen the pitch have decent bounce and carry. In many ways, we couldn't have asked for better conditions for this fantasy booking to play out in.

Australia

Marnus Labuschagne was the last one to leave the nets on the eve of the match. It was his fifth stint in there over the two days leading into Wednesday. Not that you'd expect anything less from Australia's meticulous No 3. Steve Smith had left a little while earlier after having spent another hour-and-a-half adding the final touches to his latest batting approach. The duo have been doing the same in these conditions over the last month anyway, having been part of the County Championships. And it's their consistency in routine on and off the field that's played a huge role in Australia qualifying for the final, alongside Usman Khawaja's fantastic return to Test batting supremacy. While the bowling only looks stronger with Scott Boland, despite his inexperience in England, the man with the most potential to make the difference could be Cam Green. who keeping in with the wrestling references, will go from referring to Rohit Sharma as his captain to returning to the Aussie fold and acknowledging Pat Cummins as his real captain.

Probable XI: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c)Scott Boland, Nathan Lyon

India

Rohit Sharma is an instinctive captain who doesn't mind taking decisions based on feel or facts. While Australia's line-up is largely settled, they will wait eagerly to see if they do have to contend with their long-term nemesis R Ashwin, whose place in the XI remains up in the air just like it seems to be whenever India find themselves in England. Seeing Ashwin bowl to Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne on an early-season Oval pitch after all would count as a tantalising prospect, if it were to come true. And Rohit might have meant it when he spoke about waiting till the morning of the match to take a call on the premier spinner.

While the bowling only looks stronger with Scott Boland, despite his inexperience in England, the man with the most potential to make the difference could be Cam Green. who keeping in with the wrestling references, will go from referring to Rohit Sharma as his captain to returning to the Aussie fold and acknowledging Pat Cummins as his real captain.

Probable XI: David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins (c)Scott Boland, Nathan Lyon

Rohit Sharma is an instinctive captain who doesn't mind taking decisions based on feel or facts. While Australia's line-up is largely settled, they will wait eagerly to see if they do have to contend with their long-term nemesis R Ashwin, whose place in the XI remains up in the air just like it seems to be whenever India find themselves in England. Seeing Ashwin bowl to Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne on an early-season Oval pitch after all would count as a tantalising prospect, if it were to come true. And Rohit might have meant it when he spoke about waiting till the morning of the match to take a call on the premier spinner.
Australia

Marnus Labuschagne was the last one to leave the nets on the eve of the match. It was his fifth stint in there over the two days leading into Wednesday. Not that you'd expect anything less from Australia's meticulous No 3. Steve Smith had left a little while earlier after having spent another hour-and-a-half adding the final touches to his latest batting approach.

There will, however, be a return for yet another scourge of Australia, Ajinkya Rahane who returns to the side after over 12 months to shore up a middle-order that hasn't fired very consistently in recent times. You'd think Umesh Yadav would slot in as the third seamer, playing his second WTC final, but don't rule out India backing Jaydev Unadkat to be the stock bowler who can also provide a different angle with his left-arm seam.

Probable XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravindra Jadeja, KS Bharat (wk), Ravichandran Ashwin/Shardul Thakur, Umesh Yadav/Jaydev Unadkat, Mohammed Shami, Mohammad Siraj
